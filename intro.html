            <p> 
                Greetings, my name is Jason Lee, though I am more commonly referred to as 老李. 
                I am currently seeking employment in the field of software development. 
                I have gained experience through tutoring students in various computer science subjects,
                including data structures and algorithms, machine learning, and database management. 
                My academic background includes a Master of Science degree in Data Science and Statistics 
                from the <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> University of Bath</a>, 
                as well as a Bachelor of Science in Computational Mathematics 
                from <a href="https://msu.edu/" target="_blank"> Michigan State University </a>.

            </p>

            <h1> Self Practice - HTML</h1>
            <p>
                This section pertains to my self-guided practice in front-end development utilizing 
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as potentially other backend programming languages. 
                The practice is based on the course provided by 李游, which can be accessed via 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@user-tq5fq1ee9m" target="_blank">the link</a>.
